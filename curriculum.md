Fall Semester (September - December):
Python: Advanced Python Topics and intro to Object-Oriented Programming

1. Introduction

An overview of course and expectations. Excercises to get back into programming shape!

2. Dictionaries

We will learn how to use Dictionaries which are another helpful tool in Python. These are Python's implementation of the data structure "hash tables".

3. Abstraction

We will look at a universal Computer Science, which explains how programming languages make things easier to replicate. You're already familiar with abstraction from when you created your own methods.

4. Turtle

An introduction to object-oriented programming. We will draw things using Python's turtle class.

5. Object-Oriented Programming

We will explore the power of objects! Topics will include classes, instance variables/methods, and inheritance.

6. OOP Project

We will all create a program utilizing OOP.

WINTER BREAK.

7. Introduction to Algorithms

We'll learn what an algorithm is, and how they are analyzed. We will learn about Big-O notation, a universal technique to analyze algorithm efficiency.

8. Recursion

We'll learn about recursion, a new technique to solve problems by calling methods on themselves.

9. Sorting

We'll learn how the sorting functions you've been using actually work. What are their runtimes?

10. Techniques

We'll solve some advanced level problems to utilize what we've learned this year.

11. Hashtables (time bearing)

If we have time, we'll learn the theory behind hashtables, which are how Python implements its Dictionaries.
